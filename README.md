# [BB] Servers Surf Map Configuration

This repository contains the configuration files used by [BB] Servers for **Surf maps**.

These files define map-specific logic, overrides, and structure in a mostly declarative format ‚Äî with occasional ad-hoc customizations per map. Some of this content dates back over a decade and reflects years of iterative adjustments.

## üìù Purpose

This repo exists to:

- Preserve and expose the surf map configuration used across [BB] Servers
- Enable the community to suggest improvements, bugfixes, or tweaks
- Support submission of new surf maps with pre-defined logic or settings
- Facilitate tooling or automation for map setup, testing, or metadata parsing

This is **not intended for direct installation or standalone use**. It exists purely as a collaborative configuration and archival effort.
