1. Ownership

All original code and content in this repository is either:

- Created and owned by [BB] Servers ("Project Owners"), or  
- Contributed by third-party Contributors, who retain ownership of their specific contributions.

This does not apply to third-party dependencies, libraries, or underlying language features (see Section 7). Any such components remain governed by their own licenses and are not claimed under this license.

2. Permitted Use for the Public

You may:

- View and study the code for non-commercial, personal, or educational purposes.

You may not:

- Use any part of the Project, in whole or in part, for commercial purposes without explicit written permission from [BB] Servers.
- Use or distribute the Project, or substantial portions of it, for commercial gain — including Contributions by others — unless explicitly permitted under the Contributor License Agreement (see Section 3).
- Omit or obscure attribution notices when reusing the code.

3. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

By submitting any code, documentation, or other material ("Contribution") to this Project, you agree to the following:

- You affirm that your Contribution is your original work, or that you have sufficient rights to submit and license it under these terms.

Important: As a Contributor, you may not commercially use the Project as a whole, or any part that includes contributions from others, without permission from [BB] Servers. You may only commercially use your own Contribution independently, outside of this Project.

[BB] Servers reserves the exclusive right to update or relicense this Project under new terms in the future, including relaxing or removing existing restrictions (such as those on commercial use or attribution).

Any such updates will be communicated through the Project’s official channels (e.g., repository updates, release notes, or public announcements).

- License updates may be applied retroactively only if the new license explicitly states that it supersedes this version.  
- [BB] Servers may not retroactively apply any license update that imposes stricter or more restrictive conditions on past Contributions without the Contributor’s explicit consent.
